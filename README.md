# UnityTileEditor
Custom Tile Map Editor plugin for Unity that allows loading a spritesheet, creating tiles from it and 
giving them properties, adding multiple layers to a map, and finally painting the map and exporting it in 
a convenient XML format which can be used in a game 
(in this case, it was for a Bomberman game written in custom C++ but can be used in other games too).
